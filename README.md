# Simple data set for image segmentation tasks

I was searching for a simple dataset where I can have an object and its corresponding mask (white color - object present, black color - object not present). I found nothing what I was expecting, therefore I created thsi simple script to generate 3 objects - triangles, rectangles and circles. The Python script you can just run on your machine (or you can download the sample I created from the 'shapes' folder). **Please, don't forget to change the two parameters I mentioned below:**

```python
NUM_IMAGES = 15
STORAGE_PATH = 'E:\\data_sets\\shapes\\'
```

If you use this code to generate your own data, please always cite me and [this](https://github.com/zbj3ji/Dataset_Image_Segmentation) Git repo. Thx!
